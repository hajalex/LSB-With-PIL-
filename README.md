In this Python program, we use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate images. 
The hide_message function takes an image path and a message as input, and hides the binary representation of the message inside the least significant bits of the color components in each pixel of the image. 
The reveal_message function takes an image path as input, and extracts the least significant bits from each pixel in the image to reconstruct the hidden binary message. 
Finally, we test the program by hiding a message inside an image and then revealing the message.
